'''When you run the file hello_world.py, the ending .py indicates that
the file is a Python program. Your editor then runs the file through the
Python interpreter, which reads through the program and determines what
each word in the program means. For example, when the interpreter sees
the word print followed by parentheses, it prints to the screen whatever is
inside the parentheses.
As you write your programs, your editor highlights different parts of
your program in different ways. For example, it recognizes that print() is
the name of a function and displays that word in one color. It recognizes
that "Hello Python world!" is not Python code and displays that phrase in a
different color. This feature is called syntax highlighting and is quite useful as
you start to write your own programs.'''

print("Hello Python World!")

# Using the variables

# message = "Hello Python World!"
# print(message)

# message = "Hello Python Crash Course World!"
# print(message)

# # Acceptable variable names:
# # message_1  but not 1_message
# # Spaces are not allowed 'gretting message' you should use 'greeting_message'
# # Avoid using python keywords (i.e print)
# # Variable names should be short but descriptive
# # Becareful with lower case letter 'l' and upper case letter 'O' these should be confused with 1,0

# '''The Python variables you’re using at this point should be lowercase. You won’t get
# errors if you use uppercase letters, but uppercase letters in variable names have special
# meanings that we’ll discuss in later chapters.'''

# message = "Hello Python Crash Course reader!"
# print(mesage)
